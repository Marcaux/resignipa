resignipa
=======

resignipa digitally re-signs existing .ipa bundles with Apple distribtuion certificates. 

This tool is useful when the person signing and deploying the .ipa may not be the developer.  It is also very useful for re-signing Enterprise applications when the provisioning profile expires - you dont need to re compile the appliciton.

You can update pre defined Plist poperties, such as *CFBundleDisplayName*, *CFBundleIdentifier*, *CFBundleVersion* as well as defining any other key values that you want to update in your plist.

Resign with new provisioning profile:

    ./resingipa -i test.ipa -p com_domain_app.mobileprovision -c "iPhone Distribution: ACME Ltd"


Resign with new bundle id:

    ./resingipa -i test.ipa -p com_domain_app.mobileprovision -c "iPhone Distribution: ACME Ltd" -b "my.new.bundle.id"

Resign with new bundle display name:

    ./resingipa -i test.ipa -p com_domain_app.mobileprovision -c "iPhone Distribution: ACME Ltd" -n "My New name"

Resign with new version, where app has a custom plist:

    ./resingipa -i test.ipa -p com_domain_app.mobileprovision -c "iPhone Distribution: ACME Ltd" -v "1.9" -p "custom.plist"

Resign and set name of new app:

    ./resingipa -i test.ipa -p com_domain_app.mobileprovision -c "iPhone Distribution: ACME Ltd" -o "my_new_app.ipa"

Resign with other key values to set in the Plist:
 
    ./resingipa -i test.ipa -p com_domain_app.mobileprovision -c "iPhone Distribution: ACME Ltd" -k "MyCustomKey=my value, MyOtherKey=12, CFBundleDisplayName=A new name"
